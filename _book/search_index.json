(address point 3.2) If they do explain some of the variation, they may make the analysis slightly more powerful (not that this is of particular relevance, but it may help) Given that there are not many comparisons (making the BH less reliable) and the Bonferroni would probably give you basically the same results, I suggest using the Bonferroni Also since power calc is much easier using Bonferroni (see below) 2.2.2 Power calculation Power relative to: Difference in medians Probability of obs from one group exceeding obs from another group Method Could simply simulate Much easier to do this when correcting using Bonferroni method, as the probability of picking a difference up depends on the actual differences in other tests, which obviously complicates things 2.2.3 Interpreting negative results Comment 3.1.c says that the paper should acknowledge that clinically-relevant differences may have been missed due to a lack of power Of course thats always true, but I think that the degree to which this is likely may be addressed in the following way For each non-significant finding: Calculate the 95% CI for the effect size Divide the upper and lower bounds by the standard deviation of the response This gives an estimate of the range of signal-to-noise values that are plausible given the data If these values are all small, then it would seem unlikely that vaccination can induce a clinically relevant effect by modulating this immune response, as clearly there is a lot else that influences this immune response He may counter that some of the noise is due to measurement error, but oh well This is relevant primarily for the very rare subsets, but not so much for the non-rare ones The modelling approach used would adjust for the rarity of the cells making estimation of the actual frequency for a person harder, anyway Using this approach, one can rule out very large effect sizes Questions Not quite clear what a reasonable scale would be Log10? Square root? Identity? 2.2.4 Miscellaneous Figure generation I can export the data for plotting, which Anele and/or Melisa (AM) can then create figures from Data sharing I would put whatever data I use into a folder, DataRawGelaDURT, and then the processed data into an R package called DataTidyGelaDURT that uses DataRawGelaDURT.

We fit it twice - once without confounders, and once with confounders that are pre-specified and found to be associated with the response on the basis of data exploration, namely sex and race. Only age at time of visit was available for every infant as a confounder other than these two, and it was not particularly associated with BCG status or with any of the cell types frequencies, except perhaps for CD1b and NK T cells. To calculate the standardised effect size and associated CI, we considered the following values to divide by: Standard deviation of residuals of full model Standard deviation of residuals of null model (i.e. model without BCG included) Standard deviation of data Average of standard deviation of data within BCG status We considered that the standard deviation of residuals of null model is the best option, as if there are strong confounders that explain a lot of the variation, then the role of BCG relative to what is left is made larger. The next best alternative would be one of the standard deviations of the data. The worst is standard deviation of residuals of the full model, as then large effects are made more prominent both by the effect size being larger and the residual standard deviation being smaller. 2.4.1.1.1.1 Effect of BCG in infants Table continues below Pop Age BCG effect: est.
